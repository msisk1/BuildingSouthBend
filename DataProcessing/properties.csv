ND-SB-00001,"",1880,744 West Washington,Italianate,"",West Washington,"",This lovely two storey brick Italianate was built around 1880 for Anna and Miner Listenberger who were early South Bend real estate entreprenuers. It was sold in 1886 to Miner's brother Albert who lived there until 1921. Albert rode for the Pony Express and was a prisoner of war during the Civil War before becoming the first President of Citizens National Bank. The house was converted into a funeral home in 1936 by Peter Nemeth and in the 1980s it was occupied by Ten-Ech an engineering consulting firm. It is now a single family residence.,http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/WestWashington/ND-SB-00001-03.jpg,Image credit: University of Notre Dame Architecture Library,http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/WestWashington/ND-SB-00001-04.jpg,Image credit: University of Notre Dame Architecture Library,http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/HPC Negatives/Full/Negative2300.jpg,Image credit: Historic Preservation Commission of South Bend and St. Joseph County,http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/HPC Negatives/Full/Negative2301.jpg,Image credit: Historic Preservation Commission of South Bend and St. Joseph County,Notable,41.675933,-86.26121,31,nd-sb-00001

Schneider,Downtown Historic Registry,,"This small commercial structure at 226 West Colfax was built in 1921-1922 for two sisters, Edythe J. and Gertrude J. Brown. Edythe J. Brown was a local educator who began her teaching career in 1896 in South Bend. She was later principal of Franklin, Coquillard, Kaley, and Marquette Schools and served as president of the National Education Association, Elementary Division in 1936. In 1920 she wrote the Story of South Bend, a small, 78-page book that was used to teach local history in the schools. One of South Bend's grade schools was later named for her. The building was designed by Walter W. Schneider, a local architect who had moved to South Bend in 1896 after beginning his career in Chicago with the well-known Chicago School architect, Richard Schmidt. The influences of Schneider's early training in the Chicago School of architecture are apparent in the treatment of the windows and the terra-cotta trim. Although the small commercial structure is similar in size and scale to other commercial buildings in South Bend, it is unique because of the large, Sullivan-esque terra-cotta panel that dominates the front (north) facade, the only example of this kind of detailing in the city. Several small commercial enterprises have occupied this structure which has been well-maintained. The building has retained most of its integrity, both interior and exterior, with changes only in the display window and entrance, possibly in the 1960's.",http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/HPC Negatives/Full/Negative3390.jpg,Image credit: Historic Preservation Commission of South Bend and St. Joseph County,http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/HPC Negatives/Full/Negative3391.jpg,Image credit: Historic Preservation Commission of South Bend and St. Joseph County,http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/HPC Negatives/Downtown/SBroll2-020.jpg,Image credit: Historic Preservation Commission of South Bend and St. Joseph County,http://documents.library.nd.edu/documents/arch-lib/South-Bend/HPC Negatives/Downtown/SBroll3-012.jpg,Image credit: Historic Preservation Commission of South Bend and St. Joseph County,,41.6775504,-86.2532885,23,nd-sb-00255
